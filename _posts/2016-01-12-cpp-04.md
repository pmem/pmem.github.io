The best way to learn to code is usually by implementing an example. We are going
to be creating a linked-list based queue data structure using the the
`pmem::obj::p` and `pmem::obj::persistent_ptr` classes and libpmemobj C API. But
first, a little bit of CS 101 :)

## Linked-list queue

Queue is a collection of elements with two important operations:

* `push` - adds element to the `tail` of the structure
* `pop` - removes element from the `head` of the structure

This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

The common implementations use either arrays or singly linked-lists to store
elements. As previously stated, we are going to use the latter.

### pmem_queue::push()

##### Step 1

Push operation consists of several steps. First, a new object is created that
contains the data (`value`) and a pointer to the `next` entry. Initially the
memory content of those variables is unknown, so we need to assign user input
to the `value` and `NULL` to the `next`.

##### Step 2

After we've done that, let's link the newly created object to the structure
by assigning it to the `next` field of the current tail entry. Obviously, if the
tail is `NULL` there's nothing to do :)

##### Step 3

As the last step, we have to update the `tail` variable of the queue structure to
point to our new object. If this is the first entry and both `head` and `tail` are `NULL`,
we have to remember to update the `head` as well.

### pmem_queue::pop()

##### Step 1

The first step of the pop operation is to update the `head` variable of the queue
structure to point to the `head->next` (the second entry). The object which is
being removed is currently not linked to anything.

##### Step 2

Next, the removed object has to be freed. And if there are no more entries in
the queue (the `head` variable is `NULL`) the `tail` variable has to be set to `NULL`.

## What about persistence?

When implementing algorithms that operate on persistent memory, we have to
carefully consider what happens to the data structure if the application is
interrupted (for example, by a power failure) at any moment during its operation.

The pmemobj library takes care of those issues and it's enough to simply wrap
your code in a transaction block to make it failsafe atomic (i.e. done completely or
not at all).

I intentionally described the queue operations in indivisible steps, so that it's
clear that when the algorithm is interrupted for some reason, we can end up
with either **persistent** memory leak or corrupted data structure.

## C++ implementation

As the operations were already described, and the actual implementation, in
alignment to the premise of C++ bindings, is identical to the volatile one, I'll
talk only about the data structure.

First let's define our list entry structure. As we just learned, it has to
contain a `next` pointer and a value.

{% highlight C linenos %}

struct pmem_entry {
	persistent_ptr<pmem_entry> next;
	p<uint64_t> value;
};

{% endhighlight %}

Our queue structure, which will also be our root object, consists of two fields:
`head` and `tail`:

{% highlight C linenos %}

class pmem_queue {
private:
	persistent_ptr<pmem_entry> head;
	persistent_ptr<pmem_entry> tail;
};

{% endhighlight %}

The `pmem_queue::push()` and `pmem_queue::pop()` functions look exactly like a
volatile implementation, but with a transaction block and
`pmemobj_alloc()`/`pmemobj_free()` instead of `new`/`delete`.
