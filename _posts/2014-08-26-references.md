Some very interesting research has been happening in the area of
Persistent Memory and more is emerging.  While the examples provided
here are meant as introductory and simple, some publications cover
the topic in much more depth and include complete transaction systems,
compiler/language enhancements, etc.  Here are some of the most
important publications in this space (please send links to more and
we'll include them).

One of the most impressive bodies of work in this area is **Mnemosyne**.
Read the paper:

- Haris Volos, Andres Jaan Tack, Michael M. Swift: _Mnemosyne:
Lightweight Persistent Memory_, The 16th ACM Conference on
Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating
Systems (ASPLOS 2011), March 2011, Newport Beach, California.

and explore the website, which includes full source and documentation:

Another very relevant project is **NV-Heaps**.  Read the paper:

- J. Coburn, et al.: _NV-Heaps: Making Persistent Objects Fast and Safe
with Next Generation, Non-Volatile Memories_, The 16th ACM Conference
on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating
Systems (ASPLOS 2011), March 2011, Newport Beach, Ca.

The June 2013 issue of _USENIX ;login:_ contains an article that discusses
the NVM Programming Model, including a discussion of Persistent Memory.

The NVM Programming Technical Work Group (TWG) in SNIA has over 35
companies working together on NVM programming models, including
Persistent Memory.  You can read more about the TWG and see the
programming model specification here:
