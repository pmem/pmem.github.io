In all of the previous post the code snippets and examples had persistent pointers (PMEMoid) without any type information - they were simple C structures. Very early in the development of the library we discovered that using something like that was extremely error-prone and generally difficult. That's why [considerable effort]({% post_url 2015-06-11-type-safety-macros %}) was put into encapsulating the PMEMoids with type-safe container. The end result can be compared with how `shared_ptr` and the like are done in C++11. All posts after this one will solely use the type-safety features.

### Layout declaration

All persistent memory programs that use pmemobj should have a clearly defined memory layout, preferably in its own file. To use run- and compile- time type-safety usage of special macros is required in addition to just declaring structures. For example, a layout for our string storing example would look like this:

	POBJ_LAYOUT_BEGIN(string_store);
	POBJ_LAYOUT_ROOT(string_store, struct my_root);
	POBJ_LAYOUT_END(string_store);
	
	#define	MAX_BUF_LEN 10
	struct my_root {
		char buf[MAX_BUF_LEN];
	};

Thanks to this you can now use `TOID` macro in your code.

### Typed persistent pointer

Instead of PMEMoids for all of the pointers, you should now use a following construct:

	TOID(struct my_root) root;

To dereference this you no longer have to use another variable in conjunction with `pmemobj_direct`, a preferred way is to use `D_RW` for writing and `D_RO` for reading. Like this:

	if (D_RO(root)->buf[0] != 0)
		D_RW(root)->buf[0] = 0;

Most IDEs correctly evaluate those macros and automatic code completion for types work.

### PMEMoid and TOID operations

Generally, two kinds of type-safety macros are distinguished: those that operate on raw `PMEMoid` - prefixed with `OID_`, and those that operate on typed `TOID` - prefixed with `TOID_`. All of the `pmemobj_` functions take only raw PMEMoids as arguments. We generally recommend solely using macros, but if you ever need to 'cast' TOID to PMEMoid, you can do it like so:

	TOID(struct foo) data;
	pmemobj_direct(data.oid);

All of the macros that are not prefixed with either `TOID_` or `OID_` generally take typed pointers and return them as their result (like the `POBJ_ROOT` macro).

### Run-time type-safety

Each type in a layout is internally assigned a unique number that then can be then used for verification. For instance, an update to existing software changed layout like so:

	struct my_root_v1 {
		TOID(struct foo) data;
	}

----------

	struct my_root_v2 {
		TOID(struct bar) data;
	}

To check whether your version of the layout corresponds with the existing objects, you can use following expression: 

	if (TOID_VALID(D_RO(root)->data)) {
		/* can use the data ptr safely */
	} else {
		/* declared type doesn't match the object */
	}

You can also rely on the embedded type number if you are unsure of the object type, like so:

	PMEMoid data;
	TOID(struct foo) foo;
	TOID(struct bar) bar;
	if (OID_INSTANCEOF(data, struct foo)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(foo, data);
	} else if (OID_INSTANCEOF(data, struct bar)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(bar, data);
	} else {
		/* error */
	}

Similarities to high-level languages are not accidental.

### Example

This is the last time we are going to modify the string store example. The `layout.h` modifications can be seen above. First, let's start with root object. Instead of first using the `pmemobj_root` function and then `pmemobj_direct` for the actual pointer, we can use a following line:

	TOID(struct my_root) root = POBJ_ROOT(pop, struct my_root);

Remember how I promised that the code will get even shorter? Here you go, `writer.c`:

        TX_BEGIN(pop) {
                TX_MEMCPY(D_RW(root)->buf, buf, strlen(buf));
        } TX_END

Because we don't have the `rootp` anymore, this one also becomes simpler, `reader.c`:

	printf("%s\n", D_RO(root)->buf);

As always, the example is available in the [repository](https://github.com/pmem/nvml/tree/master/src/examples/libpmemobj).
