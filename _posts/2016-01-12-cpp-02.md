title: C++ bindings for libpmemobj (part 1) - pmem resident variables

One of the biggest hurdles and error prone things about our C API is that the
user has to manually keep track of modifications to the persistent memory resident
variables while in a transaction. A special semi-transparent template property
class has been implemented to automatically add variable modifications to the
transaction undo log.

### nvml::obj::p

Let's start with the vector example from the previous tutorial series. It looked
like this:

{% highlight C linenos %}
struct vector {
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;
}

PMEMoid root = pmemobj_root(pop, sizeof (struct vector));

struct vector *vectorp = pmemobj_direct(root);
TX_BEGIN(pop) {
	pmemobj_tx_add_range(root, 0, sizeof (struct vector));
	vectorp->x = 5;
	vectorp->y = 10;
	vectorp->z = 15;
} TX_END
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the programmer has to remember to call `pmemobj_tx_add_range`
function before any modifications to the memory. In a simple case like this one
it might not be such a big deal, but once the code gets complex it may lead to
some difficult to find consistency issues.

By using the C++ API we can simplify this code like so:

{% highlight C linenos %}
#include <libpmemobj/p.hpp>

using namespace nvml::obj;

struct vector {
	p<int> x;
	p<int> y;
	p<int> z;
}

PMEMoid root = pmemobj_root(pop, sizeof (struct vector));

struct vector *vectorp = pmemobj_direct(root);
TX_BEGIN(pop) {
	vectorp->x = 5;
	vectorp->y = 10;
	vectorp->z = 15;
} TX_END
{% endhighlight %}

The template class `nvml::obj::p` does not add storage overhead. The size of
the vector structure is exactly the same as in the C version.

This mechanism works overriding `operator=` and adding the memory to the undo log
before modification. It's pretty straightforward.
