We're closing out 2017 with two big improvements to pmemkv: support for multiple storage engines,
and an improved benchmarking utility based on db_bench. These changes set the stage for some
interesting experiments to come next year, as we continue to add new features and tune performance 
of pmemkv and its utilities and bindings.
 


### Multiple storage engines

A new virtual interface (`KVEngine`) was recently introduced that allows `pmemkv` to provide
multiple storage engine implementations, without changes to utilities or language bindings
or applications using the `pmemkv` API.

There are two typical motivations for 
[creating a new engine](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#engines): 
1) to try out a significant change to an existing engine while keeping a stable version available or
2) to create an entirely new backing implementation from scratch. In either case, multi-engine
support allows new variations to be shared as early as possible, long before the new version is
considered complete, but without risk to other storage engines considered stable. Of course, the
same can be done with branches or private forks, but we're betting that incubating all our best new
ideas in one place like this will make comparative benchmarking and validation easier for everybody.

Initially `pmemkv` supports two engines -- `kvtree` for the original single-threaded hybrid
B+ tree, and `blackhole` for an engine that accepts data but never returns anything. The
`blackhole` engine is particularly useful for testing the overhead of high-level bindings.
The `kvtree` engine is used by default when no other engine is specified.

There are several new engines that we'll be auditioning in 2018, including copy-on-write and
multi-threaded implementations. Engine

are always welcome if you have an idea to try!



### Porting db_bench to pmemkv

Our original `pmemkv_stress` benchmarking tool has proven quite useful for assessing
performance, but has some limitations:

* `pmemkv_stress` only reports estimated average performance (based on millisecond timings)
rather than more accurate histograms (based on nanosecond timings)
* `pmemkv_stress` does not report effective bandwidth usage for each type of benchmark operation
* `pmemkv_stress` only supports single-threaded benchmarks (when our roadmap
emphasizes multi-threaded operations)

The outcome of these limitations is that `pmemkv_stress` results can be difficult to line up with
standard `db_bench` or `YCSB` benchmark results that we see published elsewhere.

After investigating several different solutions, we've successfully ported the `db_bench`
utility from LevelDB over as a new `pmemkv_bench` utility that shares many (but not all)
command-line parameters with the original. This `pmemkv_bench` utility replaces
`pmemkv_stress` without any loss in functionality. Note that `pmemkv_bench` has an
`engine` parameter for easy switching between available engines.
 
```
pmemkv_bench
--engine=<name>            (storage engine name, default: kvtree)
--db=<location>            (path to persistent pool, default: /dev/shm/pmemkv)
--db_size_in_gb=<integer>  (size of persistent pool in GB, default: 1)
--histogram=<0|1>          (show histograms when reporting latencies)
--num=<integer>            (number of keys to place in database, default: 1000000)
--reads=<integer>          (number of read operations, default: 1000000)
--threads=<integer>        (number of concurrent threads, default: 1)
--value_size=<integer>     (size of values in bytes, default: 100)
--benchmarks=<name>,       (comma-separated list of benchmarks to run)
    fillseq                (load N values in sequential key order into fresh db)
    fillrandom             (load N values in random key order into fresh db)
    overwrite              (replace N values in random key order)
    readseq                (read N values in sequential key order)
    readrandom             (read N values in random key order)
    readmissing            (read N missing values in random key order)
    deleteseq              (delete N values in sequential key order)
    deleterandom           (delete N values in random key order)
```  

One of the best new features here is using `--histogram=1` to generate statistical histograms
for each benchmark operation. These include mean, median and detailed tail
latency data, which is all highly informative for benchmarking and tuning.



### Why LevelDB?

We chose to port `db_bench` from LevelDB (even though the RocksDB fork has some nice additions)
because of license compatibility. LevelDB is BSD licensed (like all of PMDK) where RocksDB is GPL.

The `pmemkv_bench` utility relies on significant code ported from LevelDB.  This code is located
in a new `leveldb` source directory, with all original license and copyright headers intact. 
The only modifications to these files are minor cosmetic changes (to defines and includes)
allowing this subset of LevelDB files to be built independently of the entire LevelDB distribution.

Although `pmemkv_bench` relies on LevelDB sources, no LevelDB source code is used
in other `pmemkv` utilities or bindings or shared libraries.

We are grateful to Google for this LevelDB code and for choosing such a permissive license
for its use.



### Conclusion

If you're using an old version of `pmemkv` then you really should consider moving to the latest
build to get multi-engine support and the new `pmemkv_bench` utility. (and be sure to use
`--histogram=1` for your future benchmarking!)
