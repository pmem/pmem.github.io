### Introduction

Until now, our C++ bindings were missing one important component - persistent
containers. In 1.5 release we have introduced the first one - `pmem::obj::array`.
This container has almost the same functionality as `std::array` from C++11
but takes care of adding elements to a transaction and guarantees a fixed layout.
API for `pmem::obj::array` and `std::array` is the same, except for the following:
- `pmem::obj::array` defines [range()][cpp_array_range] method
- `pmem::obj::array` does not mark any non-const function as `noexcept`

If you want to store sequence (which length is known at compile time) of objects
on persistent memory you should always use `pmem::obj::array`. When using simple
arrays you have to remember to always add elements, which are modified, to a
transaction. `pmem::obj::array` does this automatically and eliminates possibility
of an error.

### Usage

Let's start with a simple example:

{% highlight C linenos %}
#include <libpmemobj++/experimental/array.hpp>

struct data {
	data() {
		array = {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
	}

	pmem::obj::experimental::array<int, 6> array;
}

pmem::obj::transaction::run(pop, [&] {
	ptr = pmem::obj::make_persistent<data>();

	for (auto &e : ptr->array)
		e++;

	for (auto it = ptr->array.begin(); it != ptr->array.end(); it++)
		*it += 2;

	for (int i = 0; i < ptr->array.size(); i++)
		ptr->array[i]--;
});

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, you can use `pmem::obj::array` just like an ordinary `std::array`.
For iterating over it you can use indexing operator, range-based for loops or
iterators. You can also use `std` algorithms to process the array:

{% highlight C linenos %}
pmem::obj::transaction::run(pop, [&] {
	std::sort(ptr->array.begin(), ptr->array.end());
}
{% endhighlight %}

If there is an active transaction elements (accessed using any of the above listed
methods) are snapshotted. In case of iterators returned by begin() and end()
snapshotting happens during iterator dereferencing. Of course snapshotting is only
done for elements which can be modified. In case of `const` iterators or `const`
versions of indexing operator nothing is added to a transaction. That's why,
it is extremely important to use `const` functions (cbegin(), cend(), etc.)
whenever possible. It will reduce number of snapshots and can have significant
impact on performance.

If we know upfront that we will be updating several values (possibly even the whole
array) there is a special function - [range()][cpp_array_range], which we can use
to optimize things a bit. This function returns instance of [pmem::obj::slice][cpp_array_slice],
which is a struct providing interface to access sequence of objects. It provides
indexing operators as well as begin() and end() methods (plus const and reverse
variants).

Here's sample usage:

{% highlight C linenos %}
pmem::obj::transaction::run(pop, [&] {
	auto slice = ptr->array.range(0, ptr->array.size(), 2);

	for (auto it = slice.begin(); it != slice.end(); it++)
		*it++;

	for (auto &e : slice)
		e++;

	std::sort(slice.begin(), slice.end());

	for (int i = 0; i < slice.size(); i++)
		slice[i]--;
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, you can iterate over it the same way you iterate over `pmem::obj::array`.
The difference is that elements are not snapshotted one by one, instead they are
added to a transaction in a bulk. Let's analyze what is happening in case of first
for loop in the above example. At the beginning of the loop, elements at indexes
0 and 1 will be already added to a transaction (this is done in `range()` method),
so that it will not have to be done in the first and the second iteration. In the third
iteration, elements at indexes 2 and 3 will be snapshotted and so on. Assuming size of
array equal to 6, number of snapshots will be thus equal to 3. This mechanism is
also described [here][cpp_array_iterator].

If you know that you will modify every element in the array you can call:

{% highlight C linenos %}
auto slice = ptr->array.range(0, ptr->array.size(), ptr->array.size());
{% endhighlight %}

This will add the entire array to a transaction once.

### pmem::obj::array and pmem::obj::persistent_ptr

Above examples used `pmem::obj::array` as a struct member but you can also
have direct `pmem::obj::persistent_ptr` to it. There is, however, one thing users
should be aware of while using this approach. Consider the following code:

{% highlight C linenos %}
using array_type = pmem::obj::experimental::array<int, 5>;

pmem::obj::transaction::run(pop, [&] {
		// not possible before C++17
		ptr = pmem::obj::make_persistent<array_type>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

		// always work
		ptr2 = pmem::obj::make_persistent<array_type>();
	});
{% endhighlight %}

As stated in the comment, initializing `pmem::obj::array` in `pmem::obj::make_persistent`
with list of values is only possible since C++17. This is because `pmem::obj::array`,
just like `std::array` is an aggregate type and need special initialization syntax (brace
initialization must be used). The problem is that, in order to support this,
we must check whether a type is aggregate in `pmem::obj::make_persistent` and
this check is only available since C++17.

### Summary

To summarize, if you need to use fixed-length array in your code you should
always use `pmem::obj::array`. This is currently, the only persistent container
in our library. We are, however, working on `pmem::obj::vector` and `pmem::obj::string`
so you can expect our containers collection to grow in near future.
