This project, as well as the support for persistent memory in
various operating systems, can be thought of as a _crawl, walk, run_
approach.  As byte-addressable persistence enters the market,
modified system BIOS images and device drivers expose it to
other modules in the kernel.  Despite the byte-addressability,
many of the initial usages are based on block storage device
interfaces.  But you have to start somewhere, so this is the
_crawl_ phase.  The move beyond that, we need a software
architecture for exposing persistent memory up the stack.

The picture above shows the _walk_ phase of persistent memory
support: exposing persistent memory up the stack so applications
can leverage it.  When the [SNIA NVM Programming TWG](https://snia.org/nvmp)
(Technical Work Group) was discussing how persistent memory was
exposed, there was a pervasive feeling in the group that the
best approach would leverage existing mechanisms, like the file system
naming and administrative model.  So the recommendation published
by the TWG matches the above diagram, and that's the initial
approach we see happening in the Linux community.

The idea is fairly straightforward.  We want applications to have
direct load/store access to persistent memory just as they do to
traditional volatile memory.  But since persistent memory is, well,
persistent, applications are going to need to be able to express
which blob of previously-stored data is desired when asking the OS
for direct access to it.  This is done using the well-understood
file namespace.  So walking through the path from hardware (at the bottom)
to the application (at the top) in the above picture, we see a
non-volatile DIMM (NVDIMM), which is one way of providing persistent
memory to the platform, and it is managed by a driver in the OS labeled
_NVDIMM Driver_ in the picture.  That driver provides access for
manageability, shown on the left (for things like configuration changes
and health monitoring).  The driver may also provide the common
block-based storage interfaces shown in the middle of the picture,
so that existing file systems or applications that use block storage
directly work without modification.  But the more disruptive path
(and the more interesting to this project) is the rightmost path
where the application opens a file using a _persistent memory aware
file system_ and then memory-maps that file.  This is done in Linux
using the [mmap(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap) system call.

So this is the _walk_ phase for persistent memory: when an application
memory-maps a file from a _persistent memory aware file system_ it
gets direct access to the persistence (shown in the far right arrow
in the above picture).  Unlike the page-cache-cased memory mapping
done by traditional file systems, the persistent memory aware file
system literally provides the shortest possible path
between an application and some storage!  Once things are set up and
initial page faults are taken, there's no kernel code running at all
when data is fetched from persistent memory -- the application loads
the data directly from the NVDIMM.

So what's the _run_ phase?  Giving an application a large range of
directly-mapped persistence is cool, but every application writer
will then start the complex process of managing how data structures
are laid out in that raw range of memory.  That's where libraries
come in -- to help application writers solve some of the more common
problems like memory allocation or transactional updates.  That will
be the topic for an upcoming blog entry.
