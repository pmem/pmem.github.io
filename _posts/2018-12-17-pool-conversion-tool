## Introduction

When we published the first PMDK stable release, we committed to maintaining
the stable on-media layout of persistent memory pools, so all further PMDK
changes had to be backward compatible. But we failed to accomplish this goal,
so we introduced a ``pmempool convert`` command. This tool was used to convert
pools created with previous PMDK versions, to the newer pool layout.
In 1.5 release this functionality was refactored and moved to the separate tool
called **pmdk-convert**

## Layout versions vs. PMDK releases

The on-media layout of libpmemobj pools has changed a few times since the
initial release. The mapping between the layout version and corresponding PMDK
version can be found in the following table:

|              PMDK version | 1.0 | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.4 | 1.5 |
|--------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Libpmemobj layout version |  v1 |  v2 |  v3 |  v4 |  v5 |

The on-media layout of the pools created by other PMDK's libraries
(libpmemblk, libpmemlog) has not changed since initial release, so the
conversion of those pools was never needed.

###  What conversion does?

Conversion of pools always consists of two parts:
- **Recovery** - if the pool was not closed gracefully,
all transaction logs are processed by the recovery algorithm from the current
libpmemobj version.
- **Layout changes** - now all on-media layout changes are applied, and the
layout version is incremented.

### How to convert a pool

> Conversion is not fail-safe (does not tolerate interruption), and it cannot
> be reverted. Before the conversion, the pool should be backed up

Pool conversion can be performed using ``pmdk-convert``  tool:

 ```bash
$ pmdk-convert path/to/the/pool
This tool will update the pool to the specified layout version.
This process is NOT fail-safe.
Proceed only if the pool has been backed up or
the risks are fully understood and acceptable.
Hit Ctrl-C now if you want to stop or Enter to continue.

Starting the conversion from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)
Converting from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)... Done
```

As the conversion process is not reversible, the tool asks for a confirmation
interactively. This question might be inconvenient in scripts, so it can be
automatically answered by -X fail-safety option.

```bash
$ ./pmdk-convert path/to/the/pool/  -X fail-safety
This tool will update the pool to the specified layout version.
This process is NOT fail-safe.
Proceed only if the pool has been backed up or
the risks are fully understood and acceptable.
Starting the conversion from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)
Converting from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)... Done
```
There is also another question which can be asked during the conversion from
a pool created in PMDK 1.1
```bash
$ ./pmdk-convert tests/pool
This tool will update the pool to the specified layout version.
This process is NOT fail-safe.
Proceed only if the pool has been backed up or
the risks are fully understood and acceptable.
Starting conversion from v2 (PMDK 1.1) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)
Converting from v2 (PMDK 1.1) to v3 (PMDK 1.2)...
**The conversion to 1.2 can only be made automatically if the PMEMmutex,
PMEMrwlock and PMEMcond types are not used in the pool or all of the variables
of those three types are aligned to 8 bytes. Proceed only if you are sure that
the above is true for this pool.
convert the pool? [y/N] y**
Done
Converting from v3 (PMDK 1.2) to v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4)... Done
Converting from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)... Done
 ```
this question can be answered by `-X 1.2-pmemmutex` option.

More information about this question can be found in 1.2 release notes and in
the following [issue](https://github.com/pmem/issues/issues/358),

### Conversion of the pool with remote replicas

During the conversion with remote replica the following error is printed:
```bash
$ ./pmdk-convert ./poolset
Remote replication is not supported.
Please use pmempool transform to remove remote replica
and then use pmdk-convert.
```
pmdk-convert does not support conversion of pools with remote replicas.
To convert such pools, the following workaround must be used.

1. A remote replica needs to be removed by pmempool transform command.
Before calling pmempool transform, you have to prepare a new poolset file
without a remote replica.

```bash
$ cat tests/poolset
PMEMPOOLSET
20M /mnt/mem/pool
REPLICA user@localhost remotepool.set
$ cat ./poolset2
PMEMPOOLSET
20M /mnt/mem/pool
$ pmempool transform ./poolset ./poolset2
```

2. When a remote replica is removed, the pool conversion can be
performed as usual:
```bash
$ ./pmdk-convert tests/poolset2 -X fail-safety
This tool will update the pool to the specified layout version.
This process is NOT fail-safe.
Proceed only if the pool has been backed up or
the risks are fully understood and acceptable.
Starting conversion from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)
Converting from v4 (PMDK 1.3, PMDK 1.4) to v5 (PMDK 1.5)... Done
```

3. When the conversion is done, the remote replica can be added again by
pmempool transform command:
```bash
$ pmempool transform ./poolset2 ./poolset
```

In 1.5 release we introduced an extra features flags. After upgrading pmdk
(and pool conversion for libpmemobj pools), they can be turned on for
existing pools. Detailed information about features flags can be found in
the [pool features] (https://pmem.io/2018/12/05/pool-features.html) blog post
