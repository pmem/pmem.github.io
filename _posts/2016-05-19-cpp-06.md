One of the most important features of the C++ bindings to libpmemobj is the
`persistent_ptr` smart pointer template. While using it is fairly
straightforward, the allocation and object construction with the use of the C
API is hard to get right. So like it's C++ standard's counterparts, it needed an
allocation mechanism with appropriate object construction. This is exactly what
this post will try to explain.

### Transactional allocations

Probably the most common usage of the allocating functions is within pmemobj
transactions. The easiest way to allocate an object into a `persistent_ptr` is
by doing the following:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto pop = pool_base::create(...);
persistent_ptr<entry> pentry;
transaction::exec_tx(pop, [&] { pentry = make_persistent<entry>(); });
{% endhighlight %}

Don't be taken aback by the strange transaction syntax. I will clarify
everything in one of the next blog posts. The second line just starts
a transaction and allocates one `entry` object. The more vigilant readers might
point out, that using the default constructor is arguably the most effective
way of creating objects. I could easily imagine the following constructor:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
entry(int a, double b);
{% endhighlight %}

But this is not an issue, you can just type:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto pop = pool_base::create(...);
persistent_ptr<entry> pentry;
transaction::exec_tx(pop, [&] { pentry = make_persistent<entry>(1, 2.0); });
{% endhighlight %}

And it forwards the parameters to the appropriate constructor of the `entry`
class.

Say you need an array of objects of type `entry`, or a 2-D array of said
objects. This is also possible to do using `make_persistent`:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto a = make_persistent<entry[]>(3); /* allocate an array of three entries */
auto b = make_persistent<entry[3]>(); /* allocate an array of three entries */
auto c = make_persistent<entry[3][2]>(); /* allocate a 3 by 2 array entries */
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately the constructor arguments passing does not work with arrays of
objects, so the object has to be default constructible.

When you are done with a persistent object and would like for it to be
deallocated, you need to call the complementary `delete_persistent` function.

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
delete_persistent<entry>(pentry); /* delete persistent object */
delete_persistent<entry[]>(a, 3); /* delete persistent array 'a' */
delete_persistent<entry[3]>(b); /* delete persistent array 'b' */
delete_persistent<entry[3][2]>(c); /* delete persistent array 'c' */
{% endhighlight %}

Transactional allocations are the most convenient way of creating persistent
objects, especially if the allocation is one in a sequence of operations that
have to be made atomically with respect to persistence. There is however another
way of creating objects.

### Atomic allocations

If you only need to allocate an object atomically, you do not have to start a
transaction for that. You can do that with the C API and now, of course, the
same facility is available in C++. For that you use the `make_persistent_atomic`
function template.

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto pop = pool_base::create(...);
persistent_ptr<entry> pentry;
make_persistent_atomic<entry>(pop, pentry);
{% endhighlight %}

As with transactional allocations, their atomic counterparts support both
parameter passing and array allocations.

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto pop = pool_base::create(...);
persistent_ptr<entry> pentry;
persistent_ptr<entry[]> pentry_array;
make_persistent_atomic<entry>(pop, pentry, 1, 2.0);
make_persistent_atomic<entry[]>(pop, pentry_array, 3);
{% endhighlight %}

Atomic deletions of persistent pointers is done through the
`delete_persistent_atomic` function template, much like the transactional
versions.

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
delete_persistent_atomic<entry>(pentry); /* delete persistent object */
delete_persistent_atomic<entry[]>(pentry_array, 3); /* delete persistent array 'a' */
{% endhighlight %}

_An atomic allocation/deletion guarantees an object allocation and
initialization/deletion that is atomic with respect to persistence_. This is
important enough to have a separate section to explain.

### Transactions and atomic allocations

This is the thing I absolutely have to convey clearly, **_atomic allocations and
transactions do NOT mix_**. So something like the following is not a good idea:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto pop = pool_base::create(...);
persistent_ptr<entry> pentry;
transaction::exec_tx(pop, [&] {
   make_persistent_atomic<entry>(pop, pentry); /* do NOT do this */
});
{% endhighlight %}

This might look like a small issue at first, but it could baffle you once you
encounter a transaction abort. Everything gets rolled-back, except the
allocation. You might get a persistent leak, an inconsistent state and depending
on the logic, segfaulting is also an option. Either way, don't try this at home.
It is stated in the C API, in debug builds you get a warning log, but I still
feel the need to reinforce this, because there is no way to generate
a compile time error.

To conclude, the atomic allocations API should only be used outside
transactions, but it is possible to use it within transactions. The
transactional versions can only be used within transactions. If used outside of
transaction scope, an exception is thrown.

This concludes the introduction of atomic and transactional allocations. If you
ever feel like looking at more code, try our [examples][f8602ec1] or
[tests][8e3dfe2a].

In the next blog post I will introduce what I think is the heart of the C++
bindings to libpmemobj - transactions.
