Before we go into details it&amp;rsquo;s worth having a short look at the history. About seven years ago, the first persistent memory library known as libpmem was started. The concept of persistent memory was becoming a reality. Initially, libpmem provided simple support for memory memory management on pmem. Over time, the development of hardware, software, as well as changing customer needs made it necessary to evolve the library to include new features such as support for Windows, DevDax, RAS, eADR, and others.</description></item><item><title>Memory Tiering (part 2): Writing Transparent Tiering Solution</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/memory-tiering-part-2-writing-transparent-tiering-solution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/memory-tiering-part-2-writing-transparent-tiering-solution/</guid><description>This is the second part of the series of articles about memory tiering. The first one explained what memory tiering is and why we need it, the second one will explain some mechanisms behind transparent tiering.

It contains many functional updates, API changes, and refactors, along with new tests and examples. As always, this release is available on GitHub: https://github.com/pmem/pmemstream/releases/tag/0.2.0 . Big thanks to everyone, who contributed!
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of Asynchronous API. It makes use of recently released miniasync library. It&amp;rsquo;s an extension to our existing synchronous API. pmemstream_append and pmemstream_publish gained async counterparts - pmemstream_async_append and pmemstream_async_publish.</description></item><item><title>Memory Tiering (part 1)</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/memory-tiering-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/memory-tiering-part-1/</guid><description>Extending memory capacity with PMEM Databases such as Redis (an in-memory key-value open-source database) consume a lot of memory. Since fast access is essential for them, they use DRAM to store their data. DRAM is quite expensive and has limited capacity, so a solution we propose in this blog post is to use PMEM (and in the future other types of memory available through CXL - see a pmem.io blog post about it).</description></item><item><title>Similarity Search - opportunity for PMEM</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/similarity-search-opportunity-for-pmem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/similarity-search-opportunity-for-pmem/</guid><description>At a high level, computing solves problems. These problems, even though different and individual, are sometimes somehow related. A new algorithmic challenge can usually be solved by bringing it down to a well-defined problem with an existing solution. Today, we will be talking about one of such universal solutions - similarity search, which has found its application in various areas of life, from search engines that tell us what we want to find, through recommendation engines that tell us what to watch, where to eat and what to buy, all the way to data science that provides valuable input to business decisions.</description></item><item><title>Basic asynchronous hashmap with Miniasync library</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/basic-asynchronous-hashmap-with-miniasync-library/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/06/basic-asynchronous-hashmap-with-miniasync-library/</guid><description>Miniasync library provides a framework for the composition and execution of asynchronous tasks in C. To accommodate different user-defined tasks and various types of data that they take in, libminiasync makes use of macros.
Using libminiasync for the first time can be challenging. There are multiple examples on the miniasync repo to make it easier. One of them is a hashmap example.
Hashmap example overview The hashmap example on the Miniasync repository presents a hashmap with a fixed size that allocates memory upon key-value pair insertion.</description></item><item><title>PMDK v1.12.0 Release</title><link>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/pmdk-v1-12-0-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 16:05:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/pmdk-v1-12-0-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released a new version of PMDK. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone who contributed.
In this release, we are deprecating the librpmem library and rpmemd tool. Using the librpmem library API will result in warnings and is no longer recommended. Those libraries and remote replication in libpmemobj were our experiments to try out ideas on combining persistent memory with RDMA. We learned from this experiment that this approach is not a good way to combine those technologies.</description></item><item><title>Miniasync v0.1.0 Release</title><link>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/miniasync-v0-1-0-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 16:13:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/announcements/2022/miniasync-v0-1-0-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just released a first experimental version of miniasyc library.

But that can also be one of its downsides for specific use cases. For example, if you want to use PMem as an ultra-fast storage device with low access latency.
PMem as storage impedance mismatch The reason for that is simple - block storage I/O is typically asynchronous due to its relatively high latency and high queue depths required to reach optimal throughputs.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to pmemstream</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-pmemstream/</guid><description>What is pmemstream? Libpmemstream implements a pmem-optimized log data structure and provides stream-like access to data.

I’m glad to announce that memkind 1.13.0 has been released.
Most notably, this release introduces a fixed kind for user-supplied memory area (along with the C++ allocator). Creating a fixed kind can be done by using memkind_create_fixed() function. This release also includes a new function to get the memory capacity of nodes available to a given kind - memkind_get_capacity().
For more information, see memkind man_page:

It gets even more complicated if data is modified concurrently. This blog post describes several challenges related to data visibility, using transactions in multi-threaded environments, and memory leaks.
Lock-free programming on pmem A fundamental issue (if eADR is not used) is data visibility. When a thread issues a temporal (e.g., MOV) store instruction, the modification might be visible to other threads before it is persistent (data can still be in a CPU cache).</description></item><item><title>MariaDB</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/mariadb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:21:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/mariadb/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Microsoft SQL Server 2019</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/microsoft-sql-server-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:17:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/microsoft-sql-server-2019/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Axomem</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/axomem-nucleus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:07:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/axomem-nucleus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Axomem</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/axomem-thingbase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:07:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/axomem-thingbase/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Intel VTune Platform Profiler</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-vtune-platform-profiler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:59:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-vtune-platform-profiler/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Intel Vtune Profiler</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-vtune-profiler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:59:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-vtune-profiler/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Intel Persistent Memory Watch (PMWatch)</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-pmwatch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:56:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/intel-pmwatch/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Processor Counter Monitor (PCM)</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/pcm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/pcm/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Linux Kernel Memory Tiering</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/linux-kernel-memory-tiering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/linux-kernel-memory-tiering/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Memkind Tiering</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/memkind-tiering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:27:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/memkind-tiering/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Memverge</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/memverge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 23:22:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/memverge/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Memkind 1.12.0 Release</title><link>https://pmem.io/announcements/2021/memkind-1-12-0-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 20:11:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/announcements/2021/memkind-1-12-0-release/</guid><description>Hi,

Introduction The mission of the PMDK team has always been and will always be to make programming persistent memory easier for the community of software developers. One of our goals is to help simplify the integration of persistent memory into software solutions by making it transparent as possible. Adopting ground-breaking and disruptive technology creates a chasm, which is challenging to cross at first.</description></item><item><title>API overview of pmemkv-java binding</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/10/api-overview-of-pmemkv-java-binding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/10/api-overview-of-pmemkv-java-binding/</guid><description>Pmemkv is a key-value data store written in C and C++, however, it also opens up a way to leverage persistent memory by developers who prefer high-level languages - such as Java.

I’m pleased to announce that pmemkv 1.3 has been released and is available from our GitHub pages.
This release introduces a new experimental engine - radix (single-threaded sorted map, backed by libpmemobj-cpp&amp;rsquo;s radix_tree container).
We have also extended the configuration class API and redesigned the optimized version of stree engine.
Features:
radix engine (single-threaded sorted map) config setters with type safety for common config fields stree engine optimization (single-threaded sorted map with custom comparator support) Major fixes:</description></item><item><title>libpmemobj-cpp v1.11 Release</title><link>https://pmem.io/announcements/2020/libpmemobj-cpp-1-11-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:40:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/announcements/2020/libpmemobj-cpp-1-11-release/</guid><description>Hello Community,
I’m pleased to announce that libpmemobj-cpp 1.11 has been released and is available from our GitHub pages.
This release introduces a new experimental container - persistent radix_tree along with inline_string and string_view classes.
It also introduces a new pointer type: self_relative_ptr with std::atomic specialization.
New features:
experimental radix_tree container (single-threaded sorted map) experimental inline_string class (class serves a similar purpose to pmem::obj::string, but keeps the data within the same allocation as inline_string itself) string_view class (support for compilers older than C++17) experimental self_relative_ptr and std::atomic&amp;lt;self_relative_ptr&amp;gt; specialization (persistent smart ptr which encapsulates the self offseted pointer and provides member access, dereference and array access operators - for some workloads it could be a faster alternative for persistent_ptr) Optimizations:</description></item><item><title>TieredMemDB - Redis with Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/09/tieredmemdb-redis-with-persistent-memory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/09/tieredmemdb-redis-with-persistent-memory/</guid><description>[14-Jan-2022 Note: this blog post has been updated due to the renaming of our database from MemKeyDB to TieredMemDB] Context Redis is an in-memory database that supports various data-structures and stores them in main memory. To support data durability, Redis relies on creating periodical snapshots of data or logging all commands that reach the server.
When Persistent Memory was first introduced, we&amp;rsquo;ve started working on various approaches of using it in Redis.</description></item><item><title>Static code analysis of the PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/08/static-code-analysis-of-the-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/08/static-code-analysis-of-the-pmdk/</guid><description>Introduction In the PMDK team, we focus on the quality of our codebase. One of the standard practices in the software development is a static code analysis, which improves the overall project quality and fixes bugs in the early stage of development. Since there is no silver bullet for avoiding bugs, we already use two different static analysis tools and many runtime checkers e.g. valgrind. Improving static analysis effectiveness is a separate academic problem.</description></item><item><title>Advantages of Reducing Data Movement</title><link>https://pmem.io/videos/reducing_data_movement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/videos/reducing_data_movement/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Edge Compute Deployment</title><link>https://pmem.io/videos/edge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/videos/edge/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SPDK,PMDK,and Intel VTune Summit 2020</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-2020/</guid><description>Thank you all for attending the 2020 PRC SPDK, PMDK and Intel® VTune™ Profiler Virtual Forum.

A recent pmem.io blog article described the pmemkv library, a persistent key-value store, which can be used from multiple languages. For Java, pmemkv supports three ubiquitous Java types: String, byte[], and ByteBuffer.
Another PMDK component, the Low-Level Persistence Library (LLPL) is an open source Java library (https://github.com/pmem/llpl) that gives Java developers access to persistent memory in a very fast and flexible way.</description></item><item><title>300 nanoseconds (2 of 2)</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/03/300-nanoseconds-2-of-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/03/300-nanoseconds-2-of-2/</guid><description>At the end of the first part of this blog series, I posed three fundamental questions regarding the design of failure atomic data structures for persistent memory.
What does it mean to allocate persistent memory? How to do fail-safe atomic updates? Are all data structures suitable for persistent memory? This time around, I will try to answer these questions to the best of my ability. We will return to the doubly-linked list example to see how it can be modified for PMEM.</description></item><item><title>Language bindings for pmemkv</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/03/language-bindings-for-pmemkv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/03/language-bindings-for-pmemkv/</guid><description>pmemkv is a local/embedded key-value datastore optimized for persistent memory.

There are NVDIMMs technologies, such as Intel Optane DCPMM, that provides persistency, byte-addressability, and also a high capacity when compared with DRAM modules. They can be used as an expansion of main memory and utilized by applications which consume a large amount of memory and do not require persistency, such as in-memory databases, caching engines and scientific simulations.</description></item><item><title>Memkind support for KMEM DAX option</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/01/memkind-support-for-kmem-dax-option/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2020/01/memkind-support-for-kmem-dax-option/</guid><description>Introduction Linux kernel version 5.1 brings in support for the volatile-use of persistent memory as a hotplugged memory region (KMEM DAX). When this feature is enabled, persistent memory is seen as a separate memory-only NUMA node(s). libmemkind API was extended to include new kinds that allow for automatic detection and allocation from these new persistent memory NUMA nodes.
Requirements 1. Kernel 5.1 with KMEM DAX driver enabled.
If support of KMEM DAX driver isn&amp;rsquo;t enabled in your kernel you will have to configure proper driver installation by run nconfig and enable driver.</description></item><item><title>2020 SNIA Persistent Memory Summit</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/2020-snia-persistent-memory-summit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/2020-snia-persistent-memory-summit/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Programming in Real Life 2020</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/programming-in-real-life-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/programming-in-real-life-2020/</guid><description>For more information, see the PIRL 2020 event page for all the details, slides, and videos.</description></item><item><title>300 nanoseconds (1 of 2)</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/12/300-nanoseconds-1-of-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/12/300-nanoseconds-1-of-2/</guid><description>Educating people has always been a challenge for me. I tend to skip over things I wrongly consider obvious, or do large leaps in reasoning when explaining a solution to a problem.

They now live in a separate repository, and will follow their own release cadence. And, as these libraries are considered mature and finished, no new releases are planned once the split has been tested and tagged &amp;ndash; except for defects and new requirements of underlying platforms.
Further development libvmem remains the only way to use filesystem-managed persistent memory for volatile allocations on Windows.</description></item><item><title>Aerospike</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/aerospike/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 23:06:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/aerospike/</guid><description/></item><item><title>New release of PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/10/new-release-of-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/10/new-release-of-pmdk/</guid><description>If you are following our mailing group, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed a stream of release announcements for libraries that are a part of PMDK.

libpmemkv 1.0 The primary goal of PMDK is enabling adoption of Persistent Memory. We do so by creating the building blocks that applications can utilize to support PMEM. So far, our work was mostly concentrated on important base functionality such as memory allocation or transactions, and only recently we&amp;rsquo;ve started to build on that foundation with C++ containers - making persistent memory programming easier and easier.</description></item><item><title>C++ standard limitations and Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/10/c-standard-limitations-and-persistent-memory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/10/c-standard-limitations-and-persistent-memory/</guid><description>Introduction C++ language restrictions and the persistent memory programming paradigm imply serious restrictions on objects which may be stored on persistent medium. A user can access persistent memory with memory mapped files to take advantage of its byte addressability thanks to libpmemobj and Storage Networking Industry Association non-volatile memory programming model. No serialization takes place here, thus applications must be able to read and modify directly from the medium even after application was closed and reopened or after the event of power loss.</description></item><item><title>Oracle Exadata</title><link>https://pmem.io/solutions/oracle-exadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 22:41:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/solutions/oracle-exadata/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Create a Persistent Memory Aware Caching Engine for PMemKV</title><link>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-persistent-memory-aware-caching-engine-for-pmemkv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:25:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-persistent-memory-aware-caching-engine-for-pmemkv/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Get Started with Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/videos/optane/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/videos/optane/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Create a C Persistent Memory Hello World Program Using Libpmemblk</title><link>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-c-persistent-memory-hello-world-program-using-libpmemblk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 00:24:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-c-persistent-memory-hello-world-program-using-libpmemblk/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SPDK PMDK and Intel VTune Summit PRC 2019</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-prc-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-prc-2019/</guid><description>Thank you all for attending the SPDK, PMDK and Intel® VTune™ Amplifier PRC Summit.

However, it can work with any filesystem whether it is stored in memory (tmpfs) or on any storage device. Consequently, libvmemcache will be significantly less performant if it is stored on the storage device other than NVDIMMs.
libvmemcache is an embeddable and lightweight in-memory caching solution. It is designed to fully take advantage of large capacity memory, such as persistent memory with DAX through memory mapping in an efficient and scalable way.</description></item><item><title>Create a C Persistent Memory Hello World Program Using Libpmem</title><link>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-c-persistent-memory-hello-world-program-using-libpmem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:21:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/tutorials/create-a-c-persistent-memory-hello-world-program-using-libpmem/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Convert Your Transient C++ Map Application to Use Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/tutorials/convert-your-transient-c++-map-application-to-use-persistent-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:18:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/tutorials/convert-your-transient-c++-map-application-to-use-persistent-memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>C++ persistent containers - vector</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/02/c-persistent-containers-vector/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/02/c-persistent-containers-vector/</guid><description>[Note: pmem::obj::vector&amp;lt;&amp;gt; is no longer experimental.

As you might already know if you&amp;rsquo;ve read posts linked above, pmemcheck verifies if all stores are made persistent in a proper manner. Our new tool, pmreorder, extends this functionality. It traverses the sequences of stores between flush-fence barriers made by the application, and then replays these memory operations many times in different combinations, to simulate the various possible ways the stores to the NVDIMM could be ordered by the system.</description></item><item><title>Pool conversion tool</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/02/pool-conversion-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2019/02/pool-conversion-tool/</guid><description>Introduction When we published the first PMDK stable release, we committed to maintaining stable on-media layout. This means that all future PMDK changes have to be backward compatible. Unfortunately, we weren&amp;rsquo;t successful in adhering to the strict requirements which would be needed to maintain compatibility, mostly because we made changes whose benefit far outweighed the costs. For this reason, we created the pmempool convert command. This tool was used to convert pools which were created with old PMDK versions to the newer on-media layout.</description></item><item><title>SPDK,PMDK, &amp; VTune Summit 2019</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-2019/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/spdk-pmdk-and-intel-vtune-summit-2019/</guid><description>Thank you all for attending the SPDK, PMDK and Intel® VTune™ Amplifier Summit.

Release 1.5 introduced a set of new feature flags. And since it&amp;rsquo;s imperative that system administrators have the ability to manage enabled features, we&amp;rsquo;ve added functionality that helps with that:
pmempool tool commands for managing features libpmempool API for managing features CTL namespace for setting a SHUTDOWN_STATE initial value Taxonomy of pool features Each of the toggleable features can be disabled or enabled for the given pool and the support for these features might vary depending on the library version.</description></item><item><title>Bad blocks</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/bad-blocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/bad-blocks/</guid><description>Introduction Over time, storage devices can acquire uncorrectable media errors often called &amp;ldquo;bad blocks&amp;rdquo;. A bad block is a part of a storage media that is either inaccessible or unwritable due to a permanent physical damage. In case of memory mapped I/O, if a process tries to access (read or write) the corrupted block, it will be terminated by the SIGBUS signal.
Handling bad blocks in PMDK libraries PMDK libraries can handle bad blocks if the CHECK_BAD_BLOCKS compat feature is turned on.</description></item><item><title>C++ persistent containers</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/c-persistent-containers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/c-persistent-containers/</guid><description>PMEM containers Our goal for the libpmemobj C++ bindings is to create a friendly and less error prone API for persistent memory programming. Even with persistent memory pool allocators, convenient interface for creating and managing transactions, auto-snapshotting class templates and smart persistent pointers, designing an application with persistent memory usage may still prove challenging without a plethora of niceties that the C++ programmers are used to.
The natural step forward to make persistent programming easier, is to provide programmers with efficient and useful containers.</description></item><item><title>C++ persistent containers - array</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/c-persistent-containers-array/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/11/c-persistent-containers-array/</guid><description>[Note: pmem::obj::array&amp;lt;&amp;gt; is no longer experimental.

In 1.5 release we have introduced the first one - pmem::obj::array. This container is currently placed in experimental namespace and folder (this means that both API and layout can change). It has almost the same functionality as std::array from C++11 but takes care of adding elements to a transaction.</description></item><item><title>New release of PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/10/new-release-of-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2018/10/new-release-of-pmdk/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been very quiet on this blog as of late, mostly because of the amount of work that we needed to put into our very ambitiously planned 1.5 release.

We were faced with two viable solutions: write everything from scratch or adapt an existing implementation. The obvious choice was NOT to implement from scratch. We would have to implement at least the basic containers from the C++ standard: vector, list, set, map and their multi- companions. That would be a lot of work, not to mention the testing and maintenance effort.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report Q2 2017</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/07/progress-report-q2-2017/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/07/progress-report-q2-2017/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s summer already (at least in my hemisphere) ! :) And it&amp;rsquo;s time for the next progress report.

This feature has been shaped after the mallctl() available in jemalloc.
The way it works is very simple. Developer defines a function-like entry point, decides whether or not the entry point allows for reading, writing or both, and finally specifies the argument type.</description></item><item><title>Apache Kudu Persistent Memory Enabled Block Cache</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/04/apache-kudu-persistent-memory-enabled-block-cache/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/04/apache-kudu-persistent-memory-enabled-block-cache/</guid><description>Using NVM Libraries To Add Persistent Memory Support to Apache Kudu Block Cache An early project done with the NVM libraries was adding persistent memory support, both volatile and persistent mode, into the Apache Kudu storage engine block cache.

Rather then copying any key/value data between full and new leaf, pmemkv splits leaves by swapping persistent structures in place. This minimizes write amplification and increases performance compared to copying, especially for larger key/value sizes.
The diagram below illustrates a persistent leaf being split. A &amp;lsquo;slot&amp;rsquo; is the term used in pmemkv for the grouping of a key, the Pearson hash for the key, and the value for the key.</description></item><item><title>Introducing pmemkv</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/02/introducing-pmemkv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/02/introducing-pmemkv/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve blogged before about building and optimizing key-value stores for persistent memory, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to put these ideas to the test in a more formal way.
Our new pmemkv project is an open-source key-value store that is optimized for read-heavy workloads on persistent memory. Compared with key-value stores based on the LSM algorithm, pmemkv offers higher read performance and lower write amplification. But our intent is not to deter use of LSM, only to expand the choices developers and architects have for aligning workloads to backing stores.</description></item><item><title>What's coming in libpmemobj</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/01/whats-coming-in-libpmemobj/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2017/01/whats-coming-in-libpmemobj/</guid><description>In my last post I&amp;rsquo;ve made a promise to share our plans for the near future.

In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll review the representations that work, known variations to avoid, and finally present a persistent string class that implements these best practices.
Avoid wrapping fixed-size arrays You might expect (like I did at first!) that p&amp;lt;char[size]&amp;gt; is a proper way to simply model a fixed-size string, but actually this is not correct.</description></item><item><title>2017 SNIA Persistent Memory Summit</title><link>https://pmem.io/events/2017-snia-persistent-memory-summit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/events/2017-snia-persistent-memory-summit/</guid><description/></item><item><title>PMDK for Windows</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/12/pmdk-for-windows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/12/pmdk-for-windows/</guid><description>Throughout 2016 a team of engineers from Microsoft, Intel, HPE and HPI have been working to port the PMDK project to Windows and we are happy to announce that Technical Preview release is now available!

They are mostly C++11-like implementations of different kinds of mutexes and the condition variable.

That is why we encourage using the lambda, until the C++17 standard is more widely implemented.</description></item><item><title>C++ bindings for libpmemobj (part 5) - make_persistent</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/05/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-5-make_persistent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/05/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-5-make_persistent/</guid><description>One of the most important features of the C++ bindings to libpmemobj is the persistent_ptr smart pointer template. While using it is fairly straightforward, the allocation and object construction with the use of the C API is hard to get right. So like it&amp;rsquo;s C++ standard&amp;rsquo;s counterparts, it needed an allocation mechanism with appropriate object construction. This is exactly what this post will try to explain.
Transactional allocations Probably the most common usage of the allocating functions is within pmemobj transactions.</description></item><item><title>C++ bindings for libpmemobj (part 4) - pool handle wrapper</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/05/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-4-pool-handle-wrapper/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/05/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-4-pool-handle-wrapper/</guid><description>One of the necessary steps in developing the C++ libpmemobj bindings was the introduction of an abstraction of the C pool handle. We decided to do a very simple hierarchy where the pool template inherits from a generic pool_base. This was necessary to be able to have functions/methods which do not depend on the pool&amp;rsquo;s template argument. Please note that this makes both of these handles impossible to keep in persistent memory, due to the presence of a vtable.</description></item><item><title>Persistent allocator design - fragmentation</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/02/persistent-allocator-design-fragmentation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/02/persistent-allocator-design-fragmentation/</guid><description>Implementing a memory allocator is a balance between numerous properties with the two most important being time and space constraints. Making the malloc/free routines reasonably fast is a must for the implementation to be considered usable at all. The algorithm also mustn&amp;rsquo;t waste excessive amounts of memory.
During development of the library we quickly realized that the performance characteristics will be dominated by the number of cache line flushes that will be required to perform operations in a fail-safe atomic way.</description></item><item><title>How to emulate Persistent Memory</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/02/how-to-emulate-persistent-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/02/how-to-emulate-persistent-memory/</guid><description>Data allocated with PMDK is put to the virtual memory address space, and concrete ranges are relying on result of mmap(2) operation performed on the user defined files.

It&amp;rsquo;s meant for authors of very low-level system software and language creators. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly pretty nor easy to use. The amount of macros, as well as the trickery inside them, might &amp;lsquo;amaze&amp;rsquo; even the biggest preprocessor fans ;)

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 struct vector { int x; int y; int z; } PMEMoid root = pmemobj_root(pop, sizeof (struct vector)); struct vector \*vectorp = pmemobj_direct(root); TX_BEGIN(pop) { pmemobj_tx_add_range(root, 0, sizeof (struct vector)); vectorp-&amp;gt;x = 5; vectorp-&amp;gt;y = 10; vectorp-&amp;gt;z = 15; } TX_END As you can see, the programmer has to remember to call pmemobj_tx_add_range function before any modifications to the memory.</description></item><item><title>C++ bindings for libpmemobj (part 2) - persistent smart pointer</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/01/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-2-persistent-smart-pointer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/01/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-2-persistent-smart-pointer/</guid><description>In our C API the programmer has to deal with custom pointers represented by the PMEMoid structure. Thanks to some macro magic we made it so that those PMEMoids are somewhat usable. C++ allows us to evolve this concept.
pmem::obj::persistent_ptr Almost everyone who ever touched a C++ code knows the idea behind smart pointers (for example, std::shared_ptr). Our persistent pointer works in the same way. It wraps around a type and provides implementation of operator*, operator-&amp;gt; and operator[].</description></item><item><title>C++ bindings for libpmemobj (part 3) - persistent queue example</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/01/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-3-persistent-queue-example/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2016/01/c-bindings-for-libpmemobj-part-3-persistent-queue-example/</guid><description>The best way to learn to code is usually by implementing an example. We are going to be creating a linked-list based queue data structure using the the pmem::obj::p and pmem::obj::persistent_ptr classes and libpmemobj C API. But first, a little bit of CS 101 :)
Linked-list queue Queue is a collection of elements with two important operations:
push - adds element to the tail of the structure pop - removes element from the head of the structure This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.</description></item><item><title>Performance improvements</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/12/performance-improvements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/12/performance-improvements/</guid><description>I would like to inform you about the performance improvements that have been going on in PMDK and libpmemobj in particular. We have not been standing still and we are trying out a couple of ideas on how to make our libraries even faster. Some of the improvements are smaller, some are larger.

You can basically think of it as RAID 1 within PMDK. What happens is, when you write to your pool using the pmemobj_* (memcpy, persist, and so on) primitives, it gets copied to your replicas. Yes, you can have more than one replica. In fact you can have as many as you want, but you have to keep in mind the performance penalty.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of a better object container</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/10/evaluation-of-a-better-object-container/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/10/evaluation-of-a-better-object-container/</guid><description>During performance evaluation of our library, I asked myself a following question:
Which data structure has computational complexity of &amp;ldquo;insert at end&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;remove given element&amp;rdquo; operations no worse than a doubly-linked list, but with a smaller constant?
The point of that mental exercise was to come up with a persistent data structure that could replace doubly-linked list in object stores (right now a linked lists of every single user-allocated object) and undo logs.</description></item><item><title>pmemobjfs - The simple FUSE based on libpmemobj</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/09/pmemobjfs-the-simple-fuse-based-on-libpmemobj/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/09/pmemobjfs-the-simple-fuse-based-on-libpmemobj/</guid><description>How to use it The sources of the pmemobjfs file system are available here.

It does shift a lot of work from the library onto the user who now has to think about different parallelization solutions.
This was a conscious decision with iterative approach to creating the library in mind. It was far easier to implement the current transaction support strategy and say that it works with relatively good performance than it would be to implement multi-threaded transactions straight up and say that they work and scale linearly with CPUs thrown at them (yea right).</description></item><item><title>KV-store improved &amp; measured</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/09/kv-store-improved-measured/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/09/kv-store-improved-measured/</guid><description>As promised in the previous post about the kv-store implementation I&amp;rsquo;m back with new results after implementing the optimizations I devised a month ago.

In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe an example implementation of transactional kv-store, that has two different backends, which I&amp;rsquo;ll then compare. To make things more interesting, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be your typical kv-store, since the data structure behind it won&amp;rsquo;t be a hashmap.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemcheck (part 2) - transactions</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/07/an-introduction-to-pmemcheck-part-2-transactions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/07/an-introduction-to-pmemcheck-part-2-transactions/</guid><description>In my previous blog post I described the key features of the new persistent memory analysis tool we created - pmemcheck. You should now be aware of the main pitfalls of persistent memory programming and of ways pmemcheck informs you about possible misuses of PMEM.

There are a couple of things you have to consider - data consistency being the most important one. The contemporary x86_64 architecture supports at most 8-byte atomic stores. You probably know by now, that by atomic I mean non-torn and not thread-safe. This means that you can be confident that you will not get 4 out of the 8 bytes with the new value and the rest will not be updated.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemobj (part 7) - persistent lists</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-7-persistent-lists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-7-persistent-lists/</guid><description>The pmemobj library provides non-transactional persistent atomic circular doubly-linked lists (or NTPACDLL for short) API with an interface familiar to anyone who have ever included sys/queue.h header file - it&amp;rsquo;s in fact so similar that I considered not writing this post at all, you can just search the web for CIRCLEQ example.

But it does add an overhead of maintaining an undo log of changes. A more optimal memory management can be achieved using the non-transactional atomic API the pmemobj library provides.
Fail-safe atomic allocations This API is not similar to the APIs most programmers are used to when it comes to handling memory.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemobj (part 6) - threading</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-6-threading/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-6-threading/</guid><description>All of the pmemobj library functions are thread-safe, with following two exceptions: pool management functions (open, close and friends) and pmemobj_root when providing different sizes in different threads - so as long as you are using this function the way it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be used you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. As for macros - generally only the FOREACH macros are not thread-safe for obvious reasons.

The pmemobj library contains an implemented from scratch memory allocator, that was designed with persistent memory in mind. There are two separate APIs: non-transactional and transactional.
Transactional allocations Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple snippet of volatile code:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 struct rectangle { int a; int b; }; int area*calc(const struct rectangle \_rect) { return rect-&amp;gt;a * rect-&amp;gt;b; } .</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemobj (part 3) - types</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-3-types/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-3-types/</guid><description>In all of the previous post the code snippets and examples had persistent pointers (PMEMoid) without any type information - they were simple C structures. Very early in the development of the library we discovered that using something like that was extremely error-prone and generally difficult. That&amp;rsquo;s why considerable effort was put into encapsulating the PMEMoids with type-safe container. The end result can be compared with how shared_ptr and the like are done in C++11.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemobj (part 2) - transactions</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-2-transactions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-2-transactions/</guid><description>By now you should be fairly familiar with the basics persistent memory programming, but to make sure the application is always in a consistent state you had to rely on your own solutions and tricks - like the length of a buffer in the previous example.

Memory pools If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the overview you know that persistent memory is exposed by the OS as memory-mapped files, we call them pools.
The pmemobj library provides an interface to easily manage those pools, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manually create the files or mmap them.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to pmemobj (part 0) - new programming model</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-0-new-programming-model/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/an-introduction-to-pmemobj-part-0-new-programming-model/</guid><description>The aim of this tutorial series is to introduce you to programming with persistent, byte-addressable memory using the pmemobj library.

It consist of a shortened UUID of the pool which the object comes from and an offset relative to the beginning of the pool:
1 2 3 4 typedef struct pmemoid { uint64_t pool_uuid_lo; uint64_t off; } PMEMoid; Operating on such persistent pointers is equivalent to operating on raw pointers to volatile objects represented by void *. This approach is error prone and such errors are very hard to find.</description></item><item><title>Implementing (simple) MySQL storage engine with libpmemobj</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/implementing-simple-mysql-storage-engine-with-libpmemobj/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2015 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2015/06/implementing-simple-mysql-storage-engine-with-libpmemobj/</guid><description>The focus of the pmemobj library, like the name suggests, is storing objects on a persistent medium. A different, but very common, approach of doing exactly the same is to use a database with a specialized interface to manipulate the collection of data. MySQL is one such database, it processes SQL queries by calling (usually) multiple methods of the storage engine used for the data tables that query operates on. This tutorial covers basics of the pmemobj library, including non-transactional allocations and very simple transactions.</description></item><item><title>Using the Block Translation Table for sector atomicity</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2014/09/using-the-block-translation-table-for-sector-atomicity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2014/09/using-the-block-translation-table-for-sector-atomicity/</guid><description>Persistent memory based storage is able to perform IO at byte (or more accurately, cache line) granularity. However, we often want to expose such storage as traditional block devices. The block drivers for persistent memory will do exactly this. However, they do not provide any atomicity guarantees. Traditional SSDs typically provide protection against torn sectors in hardware, using stored energy in capacitors to complete in-flight block writes, or perhaps in firmware.</description></item><item><title>Git Workflow</title><link>https://pmem.io/blog/2014/09/git-workflow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 19:55:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/blog/2014/09/git-workflow/</guid><description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve created the GitHub Repository for the PMDK, here&amp;rsquo;s a more detailed description of the git workflow we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.

Introduction The Linux pmem driver allows application developers to begin developing persistent memory enabled applications using memory mapped files residing on Direct Access Filesystems (DAX) such as EXT4 and XFS. A memmap kernel option was added that supports reserving one or more ranges of unassigned memory for use with emulated persistent memory.

Introduction The ndctl utility is used to manage persistent memory devices within the system while the daxctl utility managed device-dax instances. libndctl is required for several Persistent Memory Developer Kit (PMDK) and ipmctl features if compiling from source. If ndctl is not available, the PMDK may not build all components and features. This page describes how to install ndctl and daxctl using the Linux package repository.</description></item><item><title>Intel Optane Persistent Memory Operating System Support Matrix</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000006-intel-optane-persistent-memory-operating-system-support-matrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000006-intel-optane-persistent-memory-operating-system-support-matrix/</guid><description>Applies To Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory Linux Microsoft Windows VMWare Compatible Operating Systems for Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory Intel® Optane™ persistent memory operating system (OS) mode support information.

In particular, support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes to pmem is provided.
This library is provided for software which tracks every store to pmem and needs to flush those changes to durability. Most developers will find higher level libraries like libpmemobj to be much more convenient.

NAME libpmem2 - persistent memory support library
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A persistent memory aware file system is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>NAME

SEE ALSO
NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2022, Intel Corporation)

NAME libpmem2 - persistent memory support library
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2020, Intel Corporation)

NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the a persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/libpmem2/pmem2_badblock_clear.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/libpmem2/pmem2_badblock_clear.3/</guid><description>NAME

SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A persistent memory aware file system is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2020, Intel Corporation)

SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; struct pmem2_vm_reservation; int pmem2_vm_reservation_extend(struct pmem2_vm_reservation *rsv, size_t size); int pmem2_vm_reservation_shrink(struct pmem2_vm_reservation *rsv, size_t offset, size_t size); DESCRIPTION The pmem2_vm_reservation_extend() function extends an existing virtual memory reservation by the given size. For the function to succeed the size has to be aligned to an appropriate allocation granularity.
If the pmem2_vm_reservation_extend() succeeds in extending a reservation, it provides placeholder virtual memory range that starts from an address at the end of the old reservation.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmem2/pmem2_vm_reservation_get_address.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmem2/pmem2_vm_reservation_get_address.3/</guid><description>NAME

NAME libpmem2 - persistent memory support library
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A persistent memory aware file system is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.12/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.12/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>NAME

SEE ALSO
NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.12/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.12/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2022, Intel Corporation)

NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the a persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.9/libpmem2/pmem2_badblock_clear.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.9/libpmem2/pmem2_badblock_clear.3/</guid><description>NAME

NAME libpmem2 - persistent memory support library
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A persistent memory aware file system is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>NAME

NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2022, Intel Corporation)

NAME libpmem2 - persistent memory support library
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmem2.h&amp;gt; cc ... -lpmem2 DESCRIPTION libpmem2 provides low-level persistent memory (pmem) support for applications using direct access storage (DAX), which is storage that supports load/store access without paging blocks from a block storage device. Some types of non-volatile memory DIMMs (NVDIMMs) provide this type of byte addressable access to storage. A persistent memory aware file system is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.12/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.12/libpmem2/libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown.7/</guid><description>NAME

NAME libpmem2_unsafe_shutdown - libpmem2 unsafe shutdown
DESCRIPTION In systems with the persistent memory support, a power-fail protected domain covers a set of resources from which the platform will flush data to the persistent medium in case of a power-failure. Data stored on the persistent medium is preserved across power cycles.
The hardware guarantees the feature to flush all data stored in the power-fail protected domain to the persistent medium.</description></item><item><title>libpmem2 | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.12/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.12/libpmem2/pmem2_async.3/</guid><description>comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause comment: &amp;lt;&amp;gt; (Copyright 2022, Intel Corporation)

NAME pmemkv - Key/Value Datastore for Persistent Memory
DESCRIPTION pmemkv is a key-value datastore framework optimized for persistent memory. It provides native C API and C++ headers. Support for other languages is described in the BINDINGS section below.
It has multiple storage engines, each optimized for a different use case. They differ in implementation and capabilities:
persistence - this is a trade-off between data preservation and performance; persistent engines retain their content and are power fail/crash safe, but are slower; volatile engines are faster, but keep their content only until the database is closed (or application crashes; power fail occurs)</description></item><item><title>libpmemkv | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv_config.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv_config.3/</guid><description>NAME

NAME pmemkv - Key/Value Datastore for Persistent Memory
DESCRIPTION pmemkv is a key-value datastore framework optimized for persistent memory. It provides native C API and C++ headers. Support for other languages is described in the BINDINGS section below.
It has multiple storage engines, each optimized for a different use case. They differ in implementation and capabilities:
persistence - this is a trade-off between data preservation and performance; persistent engines retain their content and are power fail/crash safe, but are slower; volatile engines are faster, but keep their content only until the database is closed (or application crashes; power fail occurs)</description></item><item><title>libpmemkv | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmemkv/v1.5/manpages/libpmemkv_config.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmemkv/v1.5/manpages/libpmemkv_config.3/</guid><description>NAME

NAME pmempool_rm() - remove persistent memory pool
SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmempool.h&amp;gt; int pmempool_rm(const char *path, int flags); DESCRIPTION The pmempool_rm() function removes the pool pointed to by path. The path can point to a regular file, device dax or pool set file. If path is a pool set file, pmempool_rm() will remove all part files from local replicas using unlink(2), and all remote replicas using rpmem_remove(3) (see librpmem(7)), before removing the pool set file itself.</description></item><item><title>libpmempool | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmempool/pmempool_sync.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.11/libpmempool/pmempool_sync.3/</guid><description>NAME

SYNOPSIS #include &amp;lt;libpmemset.h&amp;gt; const char *pmemset_errormsg(void); DESCRIPTION If an error is detected during the call to a libpmemset(7) function, the application may retrieve an error message describing the reason of the failure from pmemset_errormsg(). The error message buffer is thread-local; errors encountered in one thread do not affect its value in other threads. The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call to a libpmemset(7) function indicated an error.</description></item><item><title>libpmemset | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmemset/pmemset_first_part_map.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/libpmemset/pmemset_first_part_map.3/</guid><description>NAME

Concept of the granularity is described in libpmem2(7).</description></item><item><title>libpmemset | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.11/libpmemset/pmemset_memmove.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/v1.11/libpmemset/pmemset_memmove.3/</guid><description>NAME

The library can be used to replicate remotely a memory region over RDMA protocol. It utilizes appropriate persistency mechanism based on remote node&amp;rsquo;s platform capabilities. The librpmem utilizes the ssh client to authenticate a user on remote node and for encryption of connection&amp;rsquo;s out-of-band configuration data. See SSH section for details.
This library is for applications that use remote persistent memory directly, without the help of any library-supplied transactions or memory allocation.</description></item><item><title>librpmem | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/librpmem/librpmem.7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/master/librpmem/librpmem.7/</guid><description>NAME

This allows the use of persistent memory as volatile memory, for cases where the pool of persistent memory is useful to an application, but when the application doesn&amp;rsquo;t need it to be persistent.
Note: Since persistent memory support has been integrated into libmemkind, that library is the recommended choice for any new volatile usages, since it combines support for multiple types of volatile memory into a single, convenient API.</description></item><item><title>libvmem | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.1/libvmem.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.1/libvmem.3/</guid><description>NAME libvmem - volatile memory allocation library

Such memory pool works in a similar manner as the memory pools provided by libvmem, except that it is created and destroyed automatically for each process that uses libvmmalloc.
The typical usage of libvmmalloc is to load it before all other libraries by setting the environment variable LD_PRELOAD.</description></item><item><title>libvmmalloc | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.1/libvmmalloc.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.1/libvmmalloc.3/</guid><description>NAME libvmmalloc - general purpose volatile memory allocation library

SYNOPSIS $ pmempool rm [&amp;lt;options&amp;gt;] &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;.. DESCRIPTION The pmempool rm command removes each specified file. If the specified file is a pool set file, all pool files (single-file pool or part files) and remote replicas are removed. By default the pmempool rm does not remove pool set files. All local and remote pool files are removed using unlink(3) call, except the pools created on device dax which are zeroed instead.</description></item><item><title>pmempool | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/pmempool/pmempool-sync.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.10/pmempool/pmempool-sync.1/</guid><description>NAME

In such case, the maximum size of the transactional object store could be limited by the capacity of a single memory device. Therefore, libpmemobj(7), libpmemblk(7) and libpmemlog(7) allow building object stores spanning multiple memory devices by creation of persistent memory pools consisting of multiple files, where each part of such a pool set may be stored on a different pmem-aware filesystem.</description></item><item><title>poolset | PMDK</title><link>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/poolset/poolset.5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/windows/master/poolset/poolset.5/</guid><description>NAME

Without DAX support in a file system, the page cache is generally used to buffer reads and writes to files, and requires an extra copy operation.
DAX removes the extra copy operation by performing reads and writes directly to the storage device. It is also used to provide the pages that are mapped into a user space by a call to mmap.</description></item><item><title>What is PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit)?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000009-what-is-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000009-what-is-pmdk/</guid><description>Answer The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK), formerly known as the Non-Volatile Memory Library (NVML), is a collection of libraries and tools designed to support development of persistent-memory-aware applications. The open source PMDK project currently supports ten libraries, which are targeted at various use cases for persistent memory with language support for C, C++, Java*, and Python*. The PMDK also includes tools like the pmemcheck plug-in for the open source toolset, valgrind, and an increasing body of documentation, code examples, tutorials, and blog entries.</description></item><item><title>What is the SNIA NVM Programming Model?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000007-what-is-the-snia-nvm-programming-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000007-what-is-the-snia-nvm-programming-model/</guid><description>Answer This Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Programming model was jointly developed between ~50 industry leading companies to address the ongoing proliferation of new non-volatile memory (otherwise known as persistent memory) functionality and new NVM technologies. An extensible NVM Programming Model is necessary to enable an industry wide community of NVM producers and consumers to move forward together through a number of significant storage and memory system architecture changes.</description></item><item><title>What programming languages does PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit) support?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000011-what-languages-does-pmdk-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000011-what-languages-does-pmdk-support/</guid><description>Answer The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) core libraries provide C APIs.

msync() flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped into memory using mmap(2) back to the filesystem. Without use of this call, there is no guarantee that changes are written back before munmap(2) is called. To be more precise, the part of the file that corresponds to the memory area starting at addr and having length length is updated.
So why is msync() not primarily used to flush dirty pages to persistent memory?</description></item><item><title>Why use PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit)?</title><link>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000010-why-use-pmdk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pmem.io/knowledgebase/faq/100000010-why-use-pmdk/</guid><description>Answer The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) is designed to solve persistent memory challenges and facilitate the adoption of persistent memory programming.
