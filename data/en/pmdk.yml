  content: "<p>The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) is a collection of libraries and tools. Tuned and validated on Linux OS, the libraries build on the DAX (Direct Access) feature allows applications to access persistent memory as memory-mapped files, as described in the <a href=\"https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf\">SNIA NVM Programming Model</a>.</p>
            <p>The source for PMDK is in this <a href=\"https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>"
