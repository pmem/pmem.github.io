title: About

This open source project is dedicated to making
_persistent memory programming_ easier for application developers.
Most of the activity is
focused on the [Persistent Memory Development Kit](/pmdk/), which builds on the
programming model for persistent memory recommended by the
[SNIA NVM Programming Technical Workgroup](https://snia.org/nvmp).

What is _persistent memory_?  See the full definition used by this
project on the [Glossary page](/glossary/).  In short, it is a
tier between memory and
storage, with attributes of both: it is byte-addressable like memory,
and persistent like storage.

#### Contacting Us

The PMDK team at
[Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com), started by
[Andy Rudoff](mailto:andy.rudoff@intel.com), created this project
on GitHub to encourage community development.  To find the source
for a specific component of PMDK, see the [repo index page](/repoindex).

Your participation, feedback, and questions are welcome!

* [Join our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/pmem) to
  participate in discussions on persistent memory programming, including
  the design of the libraries and future directions.
* Join our **#pmem** Slack channel using this [invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/pmem-io/shared_invite/enQtNzU4MzQ2Mzk3MDQwLWQ1YThmODVmMGFkZWI0YTdhODg4ODVhODdhYjg3NmE4N2ViZGI5NTRmZTBiNDYyOGJjYTIyNmZjYzQxODcwNDg).
