This open source project is dedicated to making
_persistent memory programming_ easier for application developers.
Over time, we hope to host several libraries, examples, and
documents related to persistent memory.  Current activity is
focused on the [Persistent Memory Development Kit](/pmdk/), which builds on the
programming model for persistent memory recommended by the
[SNIA NVM Programming Technical Workgroup](http://snia.org/nvmp).

What is _persistent memory_?  See the full definition used by this
project on the [Glossary page](/glossary/).  In short, it is an
emerging technology that introduces a new tier between memory and
storage, a byte-addressable storage, accessed by the application
using loads and stores like memory.  This new technology comes
with a number of challenges which is why this project was created.

#### Contacting Us

The PMDK team at
[Intel Corporation](http://www.intel.com), led by
[Andy Rudoff](mailto:andy.rudoff@intel.com), created this project
on GitHub to encourage community development.
Your participation,
feedback, and questions are welcome.  You can:

* [Create an issue](https://github.com/pmem/issues/issues) in our GitHub
  issues database.  This is a good way to report problems or request new
  features.
* [Join our Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/pmem) to
  participate in discussions on persistent memory programming, including
  the design of the NVM Library API and future directions.
* Find us on IRC on the **#pmem** channel on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net).
