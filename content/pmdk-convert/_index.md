### pmdk-convert: PMDK pool conversion tool

The **pmdk-convert** performs a conversion of the specified pool to the newest layout supported by this tool. Currently only **libpmemobj**(7) pools are supported.

The conversion process is not fail-safe - power interruption may damage the pool. It is advised to have a backup of the pool before conversion.

This tool doesnâ€™t support remote replicas. Before a conversion all remote replicas have to be removed from the pool by **pmempool transform** command.

See the <a href="manpages/master/pmdk-convert.1.html">pmdk-convert man page</a> for current master documentation and examples.

### Building The Source

Requirements:

* cmake >= 3.3

On Windows:

* [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) >= 10.0.16299

In pmdk-convert directory:

``` sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

And then:

#### On RPM-based Linux distros (Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL, SLES)

``` sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR=rpm
$ make package
$ sudo rpm -i pmdk-convert*.rpm
```

#### On DEB-based Linux distros (Debian, Ubuntu)

``` sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR=deb
$ make package
$ sudo dpkg -i pmdk-convert*.deb
```

#### On other Linux distros

``` sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/pmdk-convert-bin
$ make
$ make install
```

#### On Windows
``` powershell
PS> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
PS> msbuild build/ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```

To build pmdk-convert on Windows 8 you have to specify your SDK version in the cmake command, e.g.

``` powershell
PS> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION="10.0.26624"
```
