In the [previous article][async-blog], I wrote about a new upcoming Xeon platform feature,
Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA) - a memory-to-memory DMA engine, and what opportunities
and challenges it presents. I outlined the approach we are taking in
Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) to expose asynchronous APIs that can
take advantage of this new hardware. Lastly, I introduced libminiasync, which
is our framework for abstracting asynchronous operations.

This time, I will discuss how miniasync is being used in libpmem2 and our plans for its integration into the rest of PMDK libraries.

## Technical considerations for supporting new hardware or OS features in PMDK

PMDK is a sizable collection of existing tools and libraries. It supports various
different architectures (x86-64, aarch64, ppc64, riscv64) and systems
(Linux, Windows, FreeBSD). Introducing support for any new hardware or OS features
requires careful deliberation to ensure our software remains usable for our
existing users, no matter the platform they are using or the upgrade path they
are taking. We also need to make sure that any software abstractions for hardware
features we introduce aren't tied to any particular implementation. This is
especially important for any public interfaces since they are hard
to change after release.

With DSA, we have the perfect storm - it's both a new hardware feature and a
capability that requires a fairly extensive public interface. We also
cannot pick just one software implementation like DML to help us with our
abstraction, since we already know that there are potential users that might
wish to leverage an alternative software layer, like the one provided in SPDK.

![overview](/images/posts/async-2-overview.png)

With all that in mind, we've created miniasync - a fairly generic abstraction
for asynchronous operations. It allows us to create public APIs in PMDK libraries
that operate purely on abstract asynchronous functions, with the actual data
movement implementation provided at runtime by the user. Or not, in which case
a software callback is used.

## Integrating miniasync with pmem2

PMDK is a stack of libraries, one building on top of another. To create highly
elaborate async functionality in the highest layer of that stack, we first need
to enable everything below it, starting from the bottom - libpmem2. It is our
core library that provides the foundations for persistent memory programming. It
abstracts away the memory mapping and flushing primitives, implements
PMem-optimized memory operations like `memcpy` or `memset`, and provides
Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) APIs.

As a starting point, we are adding asynchronous `memcpy`, `memmove` and `memset`
APIs to pmem2.
```c
struct pmem2_future pmem2_memcpy_async(struct pmem2_map *map,
	void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len, unsigned flags);
struct pmem2_future pmem2_memmove_async(struct pmem2_map *map,
    void *pmemdest, const void *src, size_t len, unsigned flags);
struct pmem2_future pmem2_memset_async(struct pmem2_map *map,
    void *str, int c, size_t n, unsigned flags);
```

These functions map the regular synchronous pmem2 primitives onto asynchronous
futures provided by miniasync. But to actually use DSA, or a different
asynchronous data movement engine, users will need to explicitly assign a
virtual data mover (vdm) instance to the pmem2 map.
```c
int pmem2_config_set_vdm(struct pmem2_config *cfg, struct vdm *vdm);
```
Without this, pmem2 will use a software fallback based on its implementation
of memory operations.

To use these async functions, the software will need to define `PMEM2_USE_MINIASYNC`
prior to including pmem2.

```c
#define PMEM2_USE_MINIASYNC 1
#include "libpmem2.h"
```

This is because we've made a conscious decision to make this software feature
entirely optional, at least for now. We also made sure that the core miniasync
abstractions (futures, vdm) are header-only. This will make it easier
for existing users to upgrade PMDK version if they don't want miniasync.
It will also make it possible for us to package pmem2 into various linux and
windows repositories without having first to package miniasync.

## Future-looking plans and ideas

As I've said above, our work on asynchronous interfaces doesn't stop with pmem2.
We intend on leveraging miniasync throughout the stack of PMDK libraries. The
first example of that is in pmemstream, our work-in-progress solution for
efficient log storage and processing.

In pmemstream, we want to make a general abstraction for all types of logs. We
also want to make sure that our library doesn't just run on PMem, but also
supports a wider variety of heterogeneous memory and storage systems.
To accomplish that, we are designing our on-media layout in a way that seamlessly
supports [buffered durable linearizability][linearizability]. This means
that we can make writes fully asynchronous while still making sure that everything
remains consistent, even in the presence of failures. And obviously we are going to
use miniasync to create that asynchronous API.

Our other plans include using asynchronous APIs in libpmemobj, our transactional
object storage system. One of the enhancements that we are thinking about is
improving our undo and redo logging implementations to allow concurrent processing
of log entries, potentially reducing the time it takes for transactions to be
committed or aborted.

And, of course, we also want to use miniasync in our user-space block storage
API - libpmemblk.

## Asynchronous block storage APIs

The pmemblk library is a failure-atomic implementation of a block storage
interface on top of Persistent Memory. This is needed because PMem, unlike
standard enterprise disks, does not provide sector atomicity (because there
are no sectors). If you were to simply create a huge array of blocks and
write to it directly, you might have data consistency issues when the system crashes.
This behavior might be fine for software designed to tolerate failures,
but not for anything else. Our library addresses this problem through the use
of [Block Translation Table][btt] algorithm.

However, as I've described in my [first article][async-blog], using PMem as block
storage has an additional cost of using the CPU to perform the actual
I/O. This also applies to libpmemblk. Thankfully, with DSA and miniasync, we can
address this problem.

![overview](/images/posts/async-2-pmemblk.png)

Logically, a write in the BTT algorithm I mentioned earlier is composed
of four steps:

1. Allocating a new block for the new write.
2. Perform a memory copy to populate the newly allocated block.
3. Update metadata, pointing it to the new block.
4. Deallocate the previous block for that position.

To make the API thread-safe, the implementation protects these steps with
a myriad of locks and other concurrency mechanisms.

Out of these four operations, we want to leverage DSA for the second step, the
memory copy of the data itself. We could do this transparently by simply
replacing memcpy with an async version. But that wouldn't really allow for
concurrency. We need to break-up these steps into individual futures,
so that users can run multiple concurrent block write operations even from
a single thread. Thanks to the miniasync framework, that in itself is not much
of a problem. But we do have to be careful around existing concurrency primitives
and operating system locks - this is because holding a lock across a future boundary
might lead to deadlocks, where a single thread tries to acquire the same lock
twice, but in separate async operations.

## Summary

In this blog series, I've described the PMDK team's efforts to enable DSA in
existing and upcoming libraries. All this work is happening on
our [github][pmdk-org]. If you are interested, please take a look around and
let us know what you think. Any feedback we receive from our users is very
valuable to us.
