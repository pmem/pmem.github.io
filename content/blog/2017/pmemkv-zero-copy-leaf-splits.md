In a B+ tree, splitting a full leaf into two leaves is one of its
slowest operations, but
[pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv)
optimizes this using a zero-copy strategy. Rather then copying any
key/value data between full and new leaf,
[pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv)
splits leaves by swapping persistent structures in place.
This minimizes write amplification and increases performance
compared to copying, especially for larger key/value sizes.

The diagram below illustrates a persistent leaf being split. A 'slot'
is the term used in
[pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv)
for the grouping of a key, the Pearson hash for the key, and the
value for the key. During the split, slots having keys that sort
below or equal to the split key are untouched, but those slots in
the new leaf are marked unused. Slots where keys sort above the
split key have to be relocated to the new leaf, and those original
slots in the full leaf are marked unused.

![pmemkv internals](/images/posts/pmemkv2.png)

The main loop of the leaf split method, if reduced down to the
relevant details, looks like the code below.

```
for (int slot = LEAF_KEYS; slot--;) {
    if (strcmp(leaf->keys[slot].c_str(), split_key.data()) > 0) {
        // relocate slot data to new_leaf
    }
    // else do nothing, slot in new_leaf is already marked unused
}
```

Note that memory allocated by libpmemobj is always zero-filled, and a
zero-filled slot is considered unused by convention. So there is no
need to explicitly clear slots on a new leaf during a split. This
explains why the loop above skips any slot where the key sorts below
or equal to the split key.

Now that we've framed the problem of splitting persistent leaves, the
rest of this post will cover three solution strategies: naive copy,
copy-or-swap, and zero-copy. (hint: the last one is best!)

#### Leaf splits using naive copy

Our optimization story begins with
[pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv)
using persistent leaves (`KVLeaf`) composed of separate arrays for
hashes, keys, and values. Keys and values are modeled using a basic
[persistent string class](/blog/2017/01/modeling-strings-with-libpmemobj-c-bindings)
(`KVString`) that allows getting/setting the contents as a
C-style string.

```
class KVString {
  public:
    char* data() const;
    void reset();
    void set(const char* value);
};

struct KVLeaf {
    p<uint8_t> hashes[LEAF_KEYS];
    p<KVString> keys[LEAF_KEYS];
    p<KVString> values[LEAF_KEYS];
    persistent_ptr<KVLeaf> next;
};
```

The main loop of the leaf split method uses `KVString::set`
to copy data between leaves, and then `KVString::reset` to mark
a slot string as unused.

```
for (int slot = LEAF_KEYS; slot--;) {
    if (strcmp(leaf->keys[slot].c_str(), split_key.data()) > 0) {
        // copy key to new leaf
        KVString slot_key = leaf->keys[slot].get_rw();
        new_leaf->keys[slot].get_rw().set(slot_key.data());

        // copy value to new leaf
        KVString slot_value = leaf->values[slot].get_rw();
        new_leaf->values[slot].get_rw().set(slot_value.data());

        // reset original leaf slot
        slot_key.reset();
        slot_value.reset();
        leaf->hashes[slot] = 0;
    }
}
```

For small keys and values (that fit within the `KVString` SSO buffer),
this approach works nicely.

#### Leaf splits using copy-or-swap

As keys and values increase in size (to hundreds or thousands of bytes),
copying strings during a leaf split gets increasingly expensive. The
overhead comes not just from copying, but because all these copies
and resets are also journaled in case the persistent transaction
gets rolled back.

Luckily the `p<>` wrapper (in this case `p<KVString>`) offers a `swap`
method that switches two persistent structures in place without
copying all the data held by the structures. Exactly what we need!

We can now implement a copy-or-swap scheme by first adding `KVString`
methods to read if the string is short or long, and to provide a special
setter method for when the string is known to be short.

```
class KVString {
  public:
    char* data() const;
    bool is_short() const;                 // added
    void reset();
    void set(const char* value);
    void set_short(const char* value);     // added
};

struct KVLeaf {                            // not changed from prior version
    p<uint8_t> hashes[LEAF_KEYS];
    p<KVString> keys[LEAF_KEYS];
    p<KVString> values[LEAF_KEYS];
    persistent_ptr<KVLeaf> next;
};
```

The main loop of the leaf split method is changed to either copy a string
(if the string is sufficiently short) or simply swap `KVString` instances
(when the string is long).

```
for (int slot = LEAF_KEYS; slot--;) {
    if (strcmp(leaf->keys[slot].c_str(), split_key.data()) > 0) {
        // copy or swap key
        const KVString slot_key = leaf->keys[slot].get_ro();
        if (slot_key.is_short()) {
            new_leaf->keys[slot].get_rw().set_short(slot_key.data());
        } else new_leaf->keys[slot].swap(leaf->keys[slot]);

        // copy or swap value
        const KVString slot_value = leaf->values[slot].get_ro();
        if (slot_value.is_short()) {
            new_leaf->values[slot].get_rw().set_short(slot_value.data());
        } else new_leaf->values[slot].swap(leaf->values[slot]);

        // reset original leaf slot
        leaf->hashes[slot] = 0;
    }
}
```

Using a copy-or-swap strategy is significantly faster than doing
naive copies, but we can still improve performance and reduce write
amplification even more.

#### Leaf splits using swap

A zero-copy strategy that relies purely on `p.swap()` is generally the
fastest and most efficient, but this requires some refactoring of our
persistent structures to accomplish.

Rather than treating a 'slot' as just a logical grouping, we introduce
a `KVSlot` type to replace `KVString`. `KVSlot` maintains
hash, key, and value in a single data structure that also includes
key and value length. Where `KVLeaf` before had separate arrays for
hashes, keys and values, now `KVLeaf` has a single `KVSlot` array,
and each `KVSlot` has a single persistent buffer to store both key
and value data.

```
class KVSlot {
  public:
    void clear();
    uint8_t hash() const;
    const char* key() const;
    const char* val() const;
    void set(const uint8_t hash, const string& key, const string& value);
  private:
    uint8_t ph;                        // Pearson hash for key
    uint32_t ks;                       // key size
    uint32_t vs;                       // value size
    persistent_ptr<char[]> kv;         // buffer for key & value
};

struct KVLeaf {
    p<KVSlot> slots[LEAF_KEYS];
    persistent_ptr<KVLeaf> next;
};
```

The main loop of the leaf split method is now trivial!

```
for (int slot = LEAF_KEYS; slot--;) {
    if (strcmp(leaf->slots[slot].key(), split_key.data()) > 0) {
        new_leaf->slots[slot].swap(leaf->slots[slot]);
    }
}
```

#### Impacts on Performance and Storage Efficiency

Let's close with some rough numbers to better compare the copy-or-swap
strategy with `KVString` against the zero-copy strategy with `KVSlot`.
(The naive copy strategy is too slow to consider)

For sequential insertion of 20-byte keys with 800-byte values, using
[emulated persistent memory](/blog/2016/02/how-to-emulate-persistent-memory),
total workload time improved by 37% when switching from
`KVString` to `KVSlot` in my testing.

Storage efficiency for 20-byte keys with 800-byte values
improved by 20% switching from `KVString` to `KVSlot`. This is because
`KVSlot` always requires one persistent buffer, where `KVString` would
have required two persistent buffers per slot for this workload.
`KVSlot` also has no SSO buffers that go to waste for large values,
which is true of `KVString`.

However, storage efficiency when testing 20-byte keys with 15-byte values
decreased by 35% when switching from `KVString` to `KVSlot`. This is because
`KVString` has an internal SSO buffer that requires no additional
allocations in the case of short strings. `KVString` also saves space
by not storing string length as a persistent field but assuming use
of `strlen` instead.

#### Conclusions

The zero-copy strategy using `KVSlot` is the obvious path for
[pmemkv](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv)
moving forward, and by the time you read this, all these changes
will be available on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv).
Gains in both `Put` operation performance (our slowest operation)
and storage efficiency for larger strings easily outweigh losses in
storage efficiency for the specific case of very small strings. This
seems like the right tradeoffs for the large and semi-structured
datasets that we'd like to enable with
