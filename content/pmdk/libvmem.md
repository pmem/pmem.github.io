### Discontinuation of the project
The **libvmem** project will no longer be maintained by Intel.
- Intel has ceased development and contributions including, but not limited to, maintenance, bug fixes, new releases,
or updates, to this project.
- Intel no longer accepts patches to this project.
- If you have an ongoing need to use this project, are interested in independently developing it, or would like to
maintain patches for the open source software community, please create your own fork of this project.
- You will find more information [here](/blog/2022/11/update-on-pmdk-and-our-long-term-support-strategy/).

### The libvmem library

**libvmem** supports the traditional _malloc_/_free_
interfaces on a memory mapped file.  This allows the
use of persistent memory as volatile memory, for cases
where the pool of persistent memory is useful to an
application, but when the application doesn't need
it to be persistent.

>**Note:**
Since persistent memory support
has been integrated into [libmemkind](/memkind),
that library is the **recommended** choice for any new volatile usages,
since it combines support for multiple types of volatile memory into
a single, convenient API.
