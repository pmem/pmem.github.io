### The libvmmalloc library

**libvmmalloc** interposes the traditional _malloc_/_free_ interfaces and,
in a way fully transparent to the program, substitutes the system heap
with a volatile memory pool built on memory-mapped file.  Such memory pool
works in a similar manner as the memory pools provided by **libvmem**,
except that it is created and destroyed automatically for each process
that uses **libvmmalloc**.

The typical usage of **libvmmalloc** is to load it before all other libraries
by setting the environment variable **LD_PRELOAD**.

Man pages that contains a list of the **Linux** interfaces provided:
