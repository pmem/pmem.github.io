NAME
====

pmempool-check - Check and repair Persistent Memory Pool

SYNOPSIS
========

**pmempool check** \[\<options\>\] \<file\>

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **pmempool** invoked with **check** command checks consistency of a
given pool file. If the pool file is consistent **pmempool** exits with
0 value. If the pool file is not consistent non-zero error code is
returned.

In case of any errors, the proper message is printed. The verbosity
level may be increased using **-v** option. The output messages may be
also suppressed using **-q** option.

It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using **-r** option.
In order to be sure this will not corrupt your data you can either
create backup of the pool file using **-b** option or just print what
would be fixed without modifying original pool using **-N** option.

Available options:
------------------

**-r, \--repair**

> Try to repair a pool file if possible.

**-y, \--yes**

> Answer yes on all questions.

**-N, \--no-exec**

> Don\'t execute, just show what would be done.

**-b, \--backup \<file\>**

> Create backup of a pool file before executing. Terminate if it is
> *not* possible to create a backup file. This option requires **-r**
> option.

**-q, \--quiet**

> Be quiet and don\'t print any messages.

**-v, \--verbose**

> Be more verbose.

**-h, \--help**

> Display help message and exit.
