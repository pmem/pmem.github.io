### The libpmemset library

**libpmemset** aims to provide the core functionality any
persistent application should have.

This library is only available on two code branches:
* [stable-1.11](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/tree/stable-1.11)
* [stable-1.12](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/tree/stable-1.12)

It'd be the best choice to use the most recent release from these two branches - **1.12.1**.
