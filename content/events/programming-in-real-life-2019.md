Persistent Programming In Real Life (PIRL) 2019 will brings together software development leaders interested in learning about programming methodologies for persistent memories and sharing their experiences with others.

This is a meeting for developer project leads on the front lines of persistent programming, not sales, marketing, or non-technical management. This two-day event will enable leaders to learn what their peers have done, and want to do, with persistent memory, what worked, what was hard, and what was surprising.
