### The C++ bindings to libpmemobj

**libpmemobj-cpp** provides a less error prone version of [libpmemobj](/pmdk/libpmemobj/)
through the implementation of a pmem-resident property, persistent pointers,
scoped and closure transactions, locking primitives and many others.

Doxygen documentation is available:

* for the current [**master**](master/doxygen/index.html)
* for the latest stable branch: [**v1.13**](v1.13/doxygen/index.html)

For older documentation [see below](#older-documentation).
