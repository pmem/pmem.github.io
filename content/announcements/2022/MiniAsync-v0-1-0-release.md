We've just released a first experimental version of miniasyc library. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed.

The library provides a framework for the composition and execution of 
asynchronous tasks in C, as well as an abstract interface for hardware-accelerated 
data movement.

This release also contains:
- documentation on the implemented functionality
- basic examples
- working build system based on GHA
- functional test cases

This relase is available on github https://github.com/pmem/miniasync/releases/tag/0.1.0
