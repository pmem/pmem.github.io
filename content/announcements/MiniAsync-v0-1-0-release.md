We've just released a first experimental version of miniasyc library. I'd like to thank everyone who contributed.

The library provides the API for asynchronous memory operations
through the use of features and runtime mechanisms and independence
in terms of hardware by implementing a virtual data mover.

This release also contains:
- documentation on the implemented functionality
- basic examples
- working build system based on GHA
- functional test cases

This relase is available on github https://github.com/pmem/miniasync/releases/tag/0.1.0
