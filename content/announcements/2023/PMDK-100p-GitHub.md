The [PMDK repository](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/) on GitHub has become the ultimate source of information on PMDK from release 2.0. For all questions and to submit eventual issues please follow [that repository](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/issues).

The PMDK documentation collected on [pmem.io](/pmdk/) should be valid up to the 1.13.1 release but is maintained only on a best-effort basis and may not reflect the latest state of the art.

See you on [GitHub](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/)!
