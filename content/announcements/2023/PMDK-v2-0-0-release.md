We are pleased to announce the release of PMDK 2.0.0.

The 2.0.0 release:

Removes:
- support for Windows/FreeBSD,
- libpmemlog and libpmemblk libraries.

Significantly simplifies the validation by:
- removing experimentally supported PowerPC and ARM architectures from the regular execution,
- dropping Fedora and Debian,
- adding reference platform provisioning instructions for the PMDK testing.

Detailed release notes and source code are available on GitHub: [PMDK Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/releases/tag/2.0.0)
